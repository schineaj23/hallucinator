## TODO
- [ ] Get Link setup for timing
- [ ] Get the audio stream from Serato
    - Windows API for this?
- [ ] Slice the audio stream when we want to
- [ ] Send that to the MAGNeT code from before (polish this up)
    - May need a daemon/server that handles the processing so not blocking
    - Using python implementation, don't feel like finishing GGUF atm
